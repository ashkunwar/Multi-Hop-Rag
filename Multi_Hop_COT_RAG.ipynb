            "**1.  Diagnosis is Key:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **See a Doctor:**  Pneumonia requires medical attention. A doctor will assess your symptoms, perform a physical exam, and likely order tests like a chest X-ray, blood tests, and possibly a sputum culture to confirm the diagnosis and identify the cause (bacteria, virus, etc.).\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Treatment Tailored to the Cause:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Bacterial Pneumonia:**  Antibiotics are the primary treatment. Your doctor will prescribe the appropriate antibiotic based on the suspected bacteria and your individual health history. It's crucial to complete the full course of antibiotics even if you feel better before finishing them. This prevents the bacteria from becoming resistant to the medication.\n",
            "*   **Viral Pneumonia:**  Antibiotics are ineffective against viruses. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms like fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. This may include:\n",
            "    *   **Rest:**  Your body needs energy to fight the infection.\n",
            "    *   **Fluids:**  Staying hydrated is essential.\n",
            "    *   **Over-the-counter medications:**  Pain relievers and fever reducers can help alleviate discomfort.\n",
            "    *   **Antiviral medications:**  In some cases, antiviral drugs may be prescribed for certain viral pneumonias, but this depends on the specific virus and the severity of the illness.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Supportive Care:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Oxygen Therapy:**  If your blood oxygen levels are low, oxygen therapy may be necessary.\n",
            "*   **Hospitalization:**  Severe cases of pneumonia may require hospitalization for close monitoring, intravenous fluids, and supplemental oxygen.\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Prevention is Powerful:**\n",
            "\n",

            "*   **Handwashing:**  Frequent and thorough handwashing is crucial to prevent the spread of germs.\n",
            "*   **Avoid Smoking:**  Smoking damages your lungs and increases your risk of pneumonia.\n",
            "*   **Healthy Lifestyle:**  A healthy diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep can strengthen your immune system.\n",
            "*   **Social Distancing:**  During outbreaks of respiratory infections, social distancing can help reduce your risk of exposure.\n",

            "\n",
            "*   **Antibiotics:**  While antibiotics are effective against bacterial pneumonia, taking them unnecessarily or in excess can lead to antibiotic resistance. It's crucial to follow your doctor's instructions carefully and complete the full course of treatment.\n",
            "*   **Over-the-counter Medications:**  Always follow the recommended dosage on over-the-counter medications. Taking too much can be harmful.\n",

            "    * **Imaging:** Chest X-rays are crucial for visualizing the lungs and identifying characteristic signs of pneumonia, such as consolidation (fluid buildup) or infiltrates (areas of inflammation).\n",
